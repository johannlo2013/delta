# Delta WB - Secure JSON-based web browser
## For viewers
Download a DELTA file from a developer or use our "www.delta" file to get access to over 500+ websites on our web browser. After downloading the file, upload the file to our web browser and start browsing the DELTA internet.
## For developers
Build your own HTML file, then use an online HTML compressor to delete any unnecessary new lines and email your creation to [me via email](mailto:johannlo2013@icloud.com).
## Why choose Delta WB?
The internet is growing and isn't moderated much. Websites send your data to their servers and no one likes being tracked. So, our team at DELTA has created a moderated browser with websites that are reviewed before put into the "www.delta" file.
